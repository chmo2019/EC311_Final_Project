# Project Overview

Our final project for EC311 at Boston University is a single player VGA pong game, similar to the classic Atari game in which there is a slider on the bottom and a ball bouncing around. The objective of the game is to catch the falling ball with the paddle at the bottom. To increase difficulty we added speed with each collision, and to add our own spin on the classic several decoy balls as the game progresses. We also implemented a score counter, which increments each time there is a collision of the ball on the paddle. This score is shown on the 7-segment display as the player runs the game. If you miss the ball, the game will end displaying a game over screen before returning to the home screen.  

# How run our project

Download the zip file and modify the constraints as needed (the constraints used as for the Nexys-A7 100T FPGA board). Open the 'pong2.xpr' file with Vivado 2020.1. Then, either run the synthesis, implementation, then bitstream or program the device with top.bit under 'pong2.runs/impl_1'.  Turn the FPGA on and connect the VGA and you will see the main menu screen. To begin playing press the center button (or button corresponding to your constraints file) in order to prompt the game to run. As the game is running, use two buttons (again, left or right button or corresponding buttons in your constraints file) on the FPGA board to move the paddle left and right and catch the ball. The longer you play the more challenging it gets. As you play your score will be available on the 7-segment display. Once you lose the screen will say GAME OVER, and then press the start button again to return to the home screen that says PONG (note: the game over screen will still be present unless the player presses the left/right button in the game mode i.e. left/right not in the main menu screen).

# Code Overview

Note: the code itself without other files are contained in the 'src' directory of this Github page.

We Organized all our code into a top module call 'topmodule.v'. The top module manages the game modes (using 'increment_one.v' and a case block) and takes user input as well as feeding visual output to the user. The visual handling tasks are done by 'bg_gen.v', partially by the 'game.v', 'menu_screen.v', as well as 'score_to_7seg.v'. While the first three of those modules have VGA components, the 'score_to_7seg.v' module and 'clock_divider.v' module are responsible for converting raw numbers at appropriate timings into appropriate digits to be displayed on the 7-segment display in decimal format. Within that module, the 'dec_bcd' and 'num_hex.v' modules decode counters, fed by 'game.v', into readable, 7-segment digits on the FPGA. For the VGA displaying modules, the 'vga640x480' acts as the primary driver to create appropriate synchronization signals to animate moving pixels properly. These synchronization signal are then fed into the different game objects ('square.v', 'start_square.v', 'paddle.v') as well as the memory reading modules ('sram.v') in order to generate displayable pixels on the VGA display.
