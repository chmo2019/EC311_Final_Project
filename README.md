# Project Overview

Our final project for EC311 at Boston University is a one player variation of the classic Atari game Pong"
Though, the original game had two players, we attempted to make our game more difficult by increasing ball
speed at every collision and number of decoy balls as the game progreses. In addition, we implemented
scoring by counting the number of collisions with the ball and the paddle.
